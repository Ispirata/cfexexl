  A struct containing an algorithm/size pair to configure key crypto.

  The fields are:
    * `algo`
    * `size`

  The CFSSL API accepts the following values for `algo`:
    * `:ecdsa`
    * `:rsa`

  When `algo` is `:rsa`, `size` can be any value between 2048 and 8192.

  When `algo` is `:ecdsa`, `size` can be one of:
    * 256
    * 384
    * 521
